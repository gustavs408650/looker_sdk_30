# looker_sdk_30 – Looker API Client for Python

This module was automatically generated for Python using Swagger-Codegen. It has had minor modifications to handle cases where Python 3 does not handle binary strings in the same manner as Python 2 (ie when binary files are incorrectly assumed to be Unicode strings).

## Status and Support

This client is NOT supported or warranteed by Looker in any way. Please do not contact Looker for support. Issues can be logged via https://github.com/ContrastingSounds/looker_sdk_30/issues

## Installation

Either clone the git repository (and include in your Python script), or installing directly from GitHub using pip:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ContrastingSounds/looker_sdk_30
```

## Usage

Once installed, the module is then available as via a standard Python import, e.g.

```
import looker_client_30 as looker_client
```
